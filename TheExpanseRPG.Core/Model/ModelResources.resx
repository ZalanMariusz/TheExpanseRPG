    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>.\Characters\</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DescriptionLowerClass" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hard, usually physical, labor and precarious employment tend to rule the lives of lower class characters. Still, that work is often all that separates them from becoming outsiders, so they cling to it. Lower class characters often depend on family and friends to help keep them out of utter poverty. They might live in failing industrial areas, inner city slums, or hardscrabble farms. In all cases, they make do with what is available and find ways to stretch out resources until the next payday or job comes along.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DescriptionMiddleClass" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A measure of comfort and security comes with the middle class. A steady job, often skilled labor or “white collar,” supplies the means to afford a few luxuries or non-essentials. Middle class characters might start off as a bit insular. They often separate themselves from the struggles of the lower social classes, focusing on the climb towards upper class status. Sometimes that climb leads to a slip. They tumble down to the lower class or even become outsiders. Some settle for stability instead, and prefer not to rock the boat.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DescriptionOriginBelt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You were born and raised in the Black, on a station or ship, and have lived most, if not all, of your life out in the Belt or beyond. Separated from death by nothing more than basic support systems your whole life, you have learned to be cautious and aware of your environment.

• Your native gravity is microgravity. Belters are most comfortable “on the float” and handle moving in free-fall easily. You automatically have the Dexterity (Free-fall) focus. Conversely, Earth-normal gravity is crushingly heavy for a Belter.

• You speak Belter Creole, a combination of loan-words and phrases from various languages, combined with gestures useful for communicating while wearing a vac suit and unable to speak.

• Belters tend to be tall and willowy as a result of being raised in low - or microgravity environments. Regimens of bone - density drugs and genetic treatments are needed to keep Belters healthy, and some Belters have minor physical abnormalities because of this.

• Belters often have a diverse ethnic heritage, given the “melting pot” of the Belt, with ancestors from many different Earth cultures.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DescriptionOriginEarth" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>With a population of some 30 billion, many Earthers are unemployed and live on government-provided Basic Assistance (generally known as just “Basic”) which provides for their essential food, housing, and medical needs, but little else. You are likely one of the few to leave Earth to find a new life elsewhere.

• Your native gravity is normal gravity—“Earth-normal” or 1 g. Earthers can and do learn to operate in lower gravity, but lack the instincts of people raised in it.

• Earthers have greater muscle and bone density from being raised in a gravity well, making them shorter and more broadly built than Belters or even native-born Martians, but Earthers in space need regular exercise and medical treatments to avoid muscle atrophy and bone density loss.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DescriptionOriginMars" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Born in the Martian Congressional Republic, your life has been influenced by the Martian dream: to terraform the Red Planet into a lush and life-sustaining garden. Like the generations before you, you know that you will likely never see the completion of this work in your lifetime.

• Your native gravity is low, the gravity of Mars rather than Earth. Martians are more comfortable with microgravity than Earthers, and better able to tolerate a full 1 g than Belters, operating in-between.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DescriptionOutsiderClass" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>More of a non-social class, outsiders tend to be outcasts, criminals, or non-conformists who can’t or won’t live according to society’s customs. They often lack access to things other people take for granted and learn to get by on their own, some times forming their own support networks and structures outside of those of mainstream society. Some outsiders reject the mainstream by choice, but in many cases, outsiders are pushed out by society’s biases.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="DescriptionUpperClass" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Upper class characters sit at a society’s summit where they rarely need to worry about resources, except, of course, when they want more. Their concerns are often focused on the responsibilities and privileges associated with their status. Some are born into upper class privilege, inheriting wealth and opportunity, while others worked their way up to join the elite. In some societies, it’s almost impossible to work your way to upper class status, and even if you do, you might get less respect compared to hereditary “old money” peers.</value>
