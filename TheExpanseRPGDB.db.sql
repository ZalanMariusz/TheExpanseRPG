You can re-roll a failed Income test, but must keep the result of the second roll.','When you gain this degree, increase your Income by +1. You may add 2 to your Income score when comparing your score with an item’s cost to purchase it automatically, without a test, or to determine whether the purchase will deplete your Income. You enjoy this benefit only once per game session, and you must choose whether it applies to an automatic purchase or to avoid depleting your Income.'),
 ('Agility','You move with grace, speed, and ease.','Every move you make is part of one fluid motion. Using the Move action to stand up, climb, dismount, etc. does not reduce your Speed.','When you gain this degree, increase your Income by +1. You can re-roll a failed Income test, but must keep the result of the second roll.','When you move, terrain-based hazards do not reduce your Speed. When you fall, if you succeed at a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test with a TN determined by the GMbased on height and nearby surfaces, you suffer only half damage.'),
 ('Artistry','You can create fine works of art. For the performing arts, see the Performance talent.','You can use the Dexterity (Crafting) or Communication (Expression) focuses to create works of art. Choose a field of visual (painting, sculpture, illustration, animation, photography, etc.) or literary (poetry, fiction, scriptwriting, journalism, etc.) arts. The GM determines the time and TN of the test, depending on your intentions, and the Drama Die determines your work’s quality if you succeed. You can sell your work if you know a buyer, giving you a temporary bonus to Income tests equal to half the result of the Drama Die (minimum 1); this bonus disappears upon your first successful Income test to purchase something, or at the end of the current story if you have not used it. As an option you can waive the bonus to Income and gain a temporary reputation instead. This reputation fades over time if you don’t produce other works of similar quality. Any reputation derived from your art disappears after a number of months equal to the result of the Drama Die.','You become an undisputed master of your raft. You learn the tools and tricks of a number of artistic fields equal to your Communication, or select one of the fields you are trained in and add your Willpower to the Drama Die to determine the quality of your work. Upon successfully creating a work of art, you can re-roll the Drama Die to determine its quality, but must keep the result of the second roll.','You grow as an artist, deepening your mastery of your craft or diversifying your talents. You learn the tools and tricks of a new artistic field or gain a +1 bonus to ability tests to create works of art in a field you are trained in. This bonus also applies to the Drama Die result to determine the quality of your work.'),
 ('Attractive','You have that special something that catches and holds people’s attention and interest.','Your presence is as stunning upon the second impression as it is on the first. You can use the Making an Entrance social stunt a second time at any point of an encounter. Also, if an NPC could be attracted to you, their initial attitude is one step more favorable towards you.','Every move you make captures the attention and interest of others. When interacting with characters who would be attracted to you, you can re-roll a failed Communication (Deception, Performing, Persuasion, or Seduction) test, but must keep the result of the second roll.','You know how to best exploit your appearance. You can perform the Flirt social stunt for 3 SP instead of its normal cost, and the target of your efforts can have a Neutral attitude instead of Open.'),
 ('Burglary','You know how to bypass security to enter a place and take anything that strikes your fancy.','You know your way around security systems. When you succeed at an Intelligence (Security) test to study a lock, alarm, guards, or any part of a security system or protocol, the GM provides you with one more piece of information.','No valuable escapes your notice. If you fail a Perception (Searching) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.','Security measures cannot stop you. If you fail an Intelligence (Technology) test involving a security measure, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.'),
 ('Carousing','You take your fun seriously, and use it to good effect.','You can drink other people under the table. When making Constitution (Tolerance) tests as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die.','When you’re having a good time, you’re invincible! Or so you think. Choose the Benefit of the Doubt or Flirt stunt. You can perform that stunt for 1 SP less than its normal cost.','Choose one of the following focuses: Communication (Seduction) or Perception (Empathy). If you fail a test with your chosen focus, you can re-roll it but must keep the result of the second roll.'),
 ('Command','You are a skilled and capable leader.','Your presence inspires allies. If you take a major action to offer guidance, your allies gain a +1 bonus to Willpower (Courage) and Willpower (Morale) tests for the rest of the encounter. You can do this once per encounter.','When you stand firm, your allies stand with you. When you lead NPCs in an encounter, they do not have to make a Willpower (Morale) test until more than two-thirds of your side’s combatants are out of the fight (dead or incapacitated). If you leave the fight or are taken out, this benefit is lost.','Your allies follow your lead. Any NPCs you lead gain a +1 bonus when rolling for initiative.'),
 ('Contacts','You have a large web of social connections, and know people even in the unlikeliest places.','You can attempt to make a contact out of an NPC with a Neutral or better attitude toward you with a successful Communication (Persuasion) test. The GM sets the target number based on the likelihood of you knowing the character or having mutual friends. The more distant the character’s origin or social class from yours, the more difficult the test. If you succeed, the new contact’s attitude shifts one step in your favor and they readily provide information without a test, as long as it wouldn’t harm them. They will not perform other favors without further persuasion.','Your social skills can turn a contact into an trusted ally. If you do a significant favor for an established contact, they become Very Friendly towards you, and any potential risk in the favors you ask of them does not affect the target number of the Communication (Persuasion) test from the Expert degree. If they’re already Very Friendly, they become zealously loyal; you do not need to make an ability test to ask favors of them, regardless of the danger involved, and the GM can use your ally to provide prompts if you become stuck in the course of a story in the form of unsolicited advice or favors. Allies’ attitudes can degrade if they’re not treated well, but do not do so simply with the passage of time. You can drift apart for a decade and they’ll still be as loyal as when you last met.','Once you’ve established a contact, you can try to get a favor from them with a single successful Communication (Persuasion) test, regardless of their attitude toward you and without engaging in a complex social interaction. The target number is based on the nature of the favor and whether it puts the contact in any danger.'),
 ('Doctor','You have the skills to heal wounds and treat illness and other conditions.','You’re skilled in treating patients. You can re-roll any dice with a result of 1 or 2 when making an Intelligence (Medicine) test.','You can perform complex medical procedures to restore a patient to a normal, healthy condition, and you can re-roll any failed Intelligence (Medicine) test, but must keep the result of the second roll. When using Intelligence (Medicine) as a primary investigation focus, you generate +1 SP on any roll that generates stunt points.','With access to medical supplies and tools, you can treat some conditions. With an hour and a basic TN 11 Intelligence (Medicine) test you can remove a wounded condition, leaving the patient only injured. You can also remove other medical-related conditions with proper time and treatment, at the GM’s discretion, using the Interlude guidelines'),
 ('Dual Weapon Style','You can fight in hand-to-hand combat with a weapon in your primary hand and another in your off-hand (a secondary weapon). Unless otherwise stated, attacks come from the primary weapon.','While wielding two close combat weapons, if you take the Activate action, you gain either a +1 bonus on your melee attack rolls or a +1 Defense bonus vs. melee attacks until the end of the encounter. You can switch the bonus with another Activate action.','You can overwhelm opponents with attacks from both weapons. If you make a Melee Attack with your primary weapon and you are not charging, you can make another attack with your secondary weapon as a minor action. The second attack cannot generate stunt points, and you only add half of your Strength (rounded down) to damage.','You can perform the Lightning Attack stunt for 2 SP instead of the usual 3, but the extra attack must come from your secondary weapon.'),
 ('Expertise(Focus)','You are a specialist in your field.','Select an ability focus you have and choose a narrower task or field within it. You gain a +1 bonus for ability tests covered by the narrower task. You can select this talent multiple times, each time applicable to a different focus. You can only choose Expertise once for a particular focus.','Select one type of stunt (action, exploration, social, or command) relevant to your chosen expertise. When generating stunt points with ability tests involving your chosen expertise, you gain +1 SP for the chosen type of stunt.','If you fail an ability test covered by your chosen expertise, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.'),
 ('Fringer','You know how to navigate and survive on the fringes of civilization.','You cover your own tracks well. Other characters suffer a –2 penalty to any tests to find information about you or your activities. This stacks with the Cover Your Tracks stunt.','You are experienced at living life hidden from the system. The penalty for tests to find information about you increases to –3, and when you buy on the black market, your Income score is depleted following the normal rules.','You know how to find and navigate the local black market. Once per session, you can gain a +2 bonus on an Income test by using black market channels, but your Income is depleted by 1 regardless of the test resultand the cost of the item.'),
 ('Grappling Style','You’re skilled in restraining and subduing opponents in unarmed combat.','If you fail an opposed Fighting (Grappling) test to avoid being grappled, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.','You can perform the Pin stunt for 3 SP instead of the usual 4. In addition, your penalty to Defense when using the Grapple and Pin stunts is halved.','If you successfully hit an opponent with an unarmed attack and choose a stunt from the Grappling category, you gain 1 additional SP to apply.'),
 ('Hacking','Computer security systems and safeguards are more suggestions to you than anything else.','When you succeed at an Intelligence (Cryptography) or Intelligence (Security) test, the GM can provide you with an extra item of information about the subject. Also, you can use the Intelligence (Technology) focus instead of Communication (Investigation) and Intelligence (Research) if the information you seek can be found in an accessible computer system.','When you make an advanced test using Intelligence (Cryptography) or Intelligence (Technology), add +2 to the result of the Drama Die for the purpose of reaching the test’s threshold. You can perform the Cover Your Tracks stunt on tests involving the Cryptography and Technology focuses for 2 SP.','If you fail an Intelligence (Technology) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.'),
 ('Improvisation','Whatever the situation is, you’re sure you can handle it.','You adapt to the situation. You can make an ability test that requires a specific focus, even if you don’t have that focus. You don’t gain the focus bonus to your roll and don’t generate SP on such rolls, but in investigations you are always considered to have a tangential focus.','You can turn failure into some measure of success. If you roll doubles on a failed test, you generate SP equal to the result of the Drama Die –2 (minimum 1). The test still fails, but you can try to salvage the situation with a stunt you perform with the SP you gain. Unfortunately, your stunt cannot achieve your original intended action. The GM determines if the desired stunt is permitted, based on the situation.','Anything is a potential weapon or a tool in your hands. When you perform the Whatever’s Handy combat stunt, the penalty of your makeshift weapon is reduced by 1 and it lasts 2d6 rounds before breaking. If improvising a tool instead of a weapon, you can perform tests that require the tool, but you don’t generate SP while doing so.'),
 ('Inspire','Your words and presence motivate others to action. The benefits of Inspire do not stack, if you happen to have multiple characters on the same side who have it, other than their ability to continue inspiring their side after one or more of them has been taken out.','You inspire your friends and allies. If you are conscious and they are within sight of you, your allies gain a +1 bonus to all Willpower-related tests.','With you around, things don’t seem quite as bad. Once per encounter, you can spend two minor actions to offer words of inspiration to your allies. All who hear these words regain 1d6 + your Communication in Fortune, and receive a +2 bonus on their next test.','You inspire greatness in your friends and allies. If you are conscious and they are within sight of you, any ally generating stunt points gains +1 SP.'),
 ('Intrigue','You are a master of secrets.','You understand how to navigate complex social situations. Choose one of the following Communication focuses: Deception, Etiquette, or Seduction. If you fail a Communication test with your chosen focus, you can re-roll it but must keep the result of the second roll.','The secrets you know can raise or ruin anyone’s good standing. You can perform the Cast Out and Oozing Confidence social stunts for 1 SP lower than their normal cost. In addition, you can use Oozing Confidence to benefit another character.','You can squeeze information from the most reluctant sources. If the focus you chose in the Novice degree is considered a tangential focus during an investigation, you ignore the +2 increase to the TN of the test. In addition, if you use the focus you chose in the Novice degree to successfully complete a task in a complex social interaction, you clear two shifts instead of only one.'),
 ('Know-It-All','You can bring your considerable knowledge to bear on any situation.','You can attempt a test using an Intelligence focus somehow related to the test at hand rather than the called for ability, but with a –1 penalty. For example, using Intelligence (Business) instead of Communication (Persuasion) to convince a corporate middle-manager to agree with you. If this would be a tangential investigation focus, you do not suffer the +2 increase in TN.','When you succeed at an ability test with a knowledge focus, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of ach Drama Die on tests using related focuses for the duration of the encounter. For example, an Intelligence (Law) test can benefit Communication (Oratory) tests in a courtroom, or an Intelligence (Medicine) test can benefit a Perception (Intuition) test in a diagnosis.','You leverage every bit of information. You can perform the Breakthrough exploration stunt for 2 SP.'),
 ('Knowledge','You have an inquisitive mind and you’re a fast learner.','When you make a successful Intelligence test with a knowledge focus, the GM should give you an extra piece of information on the topic. A knowledge focus is any Intelligence focus with a description that starts with “Knowledge”, such as Business or Science. The GM determines the nature of the additional information and it may or may not be pertinent to the main question at hand.','Pick any two of your knowledge focuses. When making tests using those focuses, you can re-roll a failed test but must keep the result of the second roll.','When making Intelligence (Research) tests as part of an advanced test, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die.'),
 ('Linguistics','You pick up new languages easily. When you learn a new language, you learn to both speak and read it.','You learn an additional language.','You learn three additional languages for a total of six plus your native language(s). You can also pick any one additional language you know and speak it like a native—that is, without any trace of an accent.','You learn two additional languages for a total of three plus your native language(s). You can also imitate a specific dialect with a successful Communication (Performance) test.'),
 ('Maker','Make-it-yourself is your motto and you use manufacturing focuses to do just that. Use Dexterity (Craft) for most handcrafted and artistic items and Intelligence (Engineering) for most technological items. The GM may approve other manufacturing focuses as appropriate for certain items.','You can use a manufacturing focus to make any item with the appropriate tools and access to a workshop.','When you perform an advanced test with a manufacturing focus, you gain a +1 bonus to the result of each Drama Die for the purpose of reaching the success threshold.','Your workmanship is reliable and steady. If you fail a test with a manufacturing focus, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.'),
 ('Medic','You can treat certain conditions in the field.','Your treatment allows a patient to add your Intelligence (and Medicine focus, if any) to a test to avoid or overcome a medical hazard, or grants the patient a new test to overcome that hazard, if there is one. This includes aving a patient from dying and reviving an unconscious character.','You can quickly treat wounds to prevent them from becoming serious. If you treat a wounded condition within an hour of it occurring, you can make a basic TN 13 Intelligence (Medicine) test. Success downgrades the wounded condition to injured.','If you treat a patient, you can alleviate the effects of the exhausted, fatigued, injured, or wounded conditions. This takes an advanced TN 11 Intelligence (Medicine) test (threshold 5) with each roll taking one minute. If you succeed, the patient ignores the effects of those conditions for 1d6 hours. The conditions are still  present, however, and the effects return when the duration ends or if any of the conditions worsen, such as an injured character becoming wounded, for example.'),
 ('Misdirection','You can sow confusion among friends and foes alike.','As a major action, you can make a Communication (Deception) test opposed by an opponent’s Willpower (Self-Discipline); if you succeed, your opponent cannot perform stunts until the end of your next turn.','When you use a Communication focus in combat and roll doubles, you gain +1 SP.','Your targets become too focused on you to do anything else. When you use the Over Here! exploration stunt, the bonus your allies gain is +2 instead of +1, and you gain a +1 bonus yourself.'),
 ('Observation','You have an eye for detail.','You notice things others do not. Choose a Perception focus. If you fail a Perception test with your chosen focus, you can re-roll it but must keep the result of the second roll.','Nothing escapes your scrutiny. On a successful Perception test, you can spend 2 SP and gain a +2 bonus to all Perception tests involving the same object or subject as the first test for the duration of the encounter.','Analysis of your observation often leads to insight. On a successful Perception test, you can spend 2 SP to make a second, immediate Perception test with the same TN but with a different focus than the first, and gain additional information (if any) from a successful test with the second focus. This includes additional information when you uncover the clue within a lead.'),
 ('Oratory','You are a skilled public speaker who can sway others with your words.','You know how to work a crowd. If you fail a Communication (Persuasion) test when trying to convince a group (not an individual), you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.','You can agitate a crowd. If you make a successful Communication (Persuasion) test when addressing a group and the result of your Drama Die is 5 or 6, you rouse them to immediate action. You can’t necessarily control what they do, though you can try todo so with Communication (Leadership) tests, but they take your words to heart and act on them regardless.','Each time you perform the Sway the Crowd social stunt, you affect three additional people instead of one.'),
 ('Overwhelm Style','In hand-to-hand combat, you are relentless and overwhelming.','When you make a close combat attack, you can take up to a –3 penalty on your attack roll to receive a corresponding bonus to your damage roll.','You break opponent’s defenses with brutal or relentless attacks. If you spend 3 SP after a successful attack, your target must make an opposed Strength (Might) test against your attack roll; if they fail, they suffer a –2 penalty to Defense until the end of your next turn.','Your expertise makes you dangerous. When you succeed with a close combat attack, you can add your focus bonus for that attack to your damage total.'),
 ('Performance','You have a talent for the performing arts.','Choose a form of performance art, such as playing a musical instrument, singing, acting, dancing, miming, stand-up comedy, juggling, or any other art  performed in front of an audience. You are an accomplished performer in your chosen art. In addition, you may perform the From the Heart and Sway the Crowd stunts for 1 SP less than their normal cost.','You can add an additional form of performance to your repertoire. When performing, you exude confidence and style. You may perform the With a Flourish stunt while performing in front of an audience for 3 SP, and its effects last until the end of the day.','You can add an additional form of performance. You get a feel for a room and adapt accordingly. If you have at least 15 minutes to observe a crowd before performing or speaking in front of them, you gain a +1 bonus to any Communication-based tests to persuade or entertain them. You can also choose a number of individuals in the crowd equal to your Perception (minimum 1); at the end of the 15 minutes of observation you know their initial attitudes toward you, and you know if they changed by the end of your performance and, if so, by how much.'),
 ('Pilot','Any vehicle under your control becomes like an extension of yourself.','You are quick to get things going. Starting up a vehicle is a free action for you, and you can perform Dexterity (Driving or Piloting) tests as a minor action.','If you fail an ability test to control a vehicle, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll. In addition, while you are at the controls, your vehicle gains a +2 bonus to Defense as long as it is moving.','You push the performance of your means of transportation. When you control a vehicle, it gains a +2 bonus to tests involving its speed.'),
 ('Pinpoint Accuracy','If you can see it, you can hit it. Hard.','You strike where it hurts the most. Once per round, you can add 1d6 to the damage of a successful attack if your Dexterity is greater than your target’s.','You can perform the Called Shot action stunt for 3 SP. You can also use it with any weapon, not just guns.','Your instinct is as sharp as your eyes. When you take the Aim action, the attack bonus you gain is +2 instead of +1.'),
 ('Pistol Style','Between the quick and the dead, you prefer the former.','You are deadlier close-up. You gain a +1 bonus to damage with pistols against targets within 6 meters.','When hitting a target with a shot from a pistol, you can add your Dexterity to the damage total.','If you have a pistol in your hand, or draw or grab one as your first available action, you can roll initiative with an Accuracy (Pistols) test instead of a Dexterity (Initiative) test. You can also generate stunt points with this test, unlike a normal initiative roll, and spend them on general combat or gun stunts.'),
 ('Protector','You are the shield that protects your friends.','Your desire to protect others lends you speed. When you perform the Blockade action stunt, you can move up to 6 meters instead of 3.','You become the shadow of those who would hurt others. If you are standing next to an opponent and that opponent moves within 2 meters of one of your allies, you can move adjacent to the opponent before they finish their turn, even if it would surpass your Speed. Your Speed is 0 on your next turn.','You react quickly to put yourself in harm’s way. When you perform the Guardian Angel action stunt, the amount of damage you take instead of your ally is equal to the number of SP spent +2.'),
 ('Quick Reflexes','You react to threats instantly and instinctually.','You can prepare for action in an instant. Once per round on your turn you can use Ready as a free action.','It is hard to get the drop on you. You may re-roll your initiative roll at the start of a combat encounter, but must keep the results of the second roll.','You can go prone or stand up as a free action rather than as part of a Move action.'),
 ('Rifle Style','A rifle is far more dangerous in your hands.','You can assume a highly ready stance; as long as you are not moving more than half your normal speed, you can make an attack with a loaded rifle you are holding as a reaction before rolling initiative, even if surprised. This attack uses up your major action for the round, which means that you only have a minor action available during your next turn.','Penalties to the attack roll due to range do not apply to your attacks with a rifle.','You trust in your weapon’s power to punch through cover. The attack roll modifier for a target behind light cover does not apply to your attacks with a rifle. This includes the penalty from the Human Shield action stunt.'),
 ('Scouting','You are skilled in reconnaissance and infiltration.','If you fail a Dexterity (Stealth) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.','You are a skilled observer. If you fail a Perception (Seeing) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.','You know how to get the drop on opponents. You can perform the Seize the Initiative stunt for 2 SP.'),
 ('Self-Defense Style','You are trained in martial arts focused on defense and deflection.','You use your opponent’s momentum against them. When a melee attack misses you, you can use the Grapple action stunt as a reaction without spending any SP. In addition, you can perform the Knock Prone action stunt for 1 SP instead of the usual 2 against an opponent you have grappled.','You counter an opponent with grace and skill. When you perform the Disarm stunt, you can retain hold of the weapon. In addition, when you spend SP on Knock Prone after making a Fighting (Grappling) attack, you may automatically move your opponent 2 yards for no additional SP cost. You may increase this distance with the Skirmish stunt. The enemy falls prone after being moved.','Your grip is difficult to break. If you fail a Fighting (Grappling) test, you can re-roll it, but must keep the results of the second roll.'),
 ('Single Weapon Style','You can fight more effectively wielding a single-handed melee weapon.','Fighting with a single-handed weapon demands increased awareness. If you take the Activate action, you gain a +1 Defense bonus until the end of the encounter while fighting in this style.','You know how to fight several enemies at once. Opponents making melee attacks against you never gain a bonus on their attack rolls for outnumbering you.','You can wield your weapon to block and parry attacks. Your bonus to Defense increases to +2 while fighting in this style.'),
 ('Striking Style','By training or raw talent, your unarmed strikes leave a lasting impression.','When you attack unarmed, you inflict 1d6 damage instead of 1d3.','You can perform the Injure or Vicious Blow action stunts for 1 SP when attacking unarmed.','Your punch can drop the toughest opponents. You can perform the Knock Prone stunt for 1 SP when attacking unarmed.'),
 ('Tactical Awareness','You move calmly and expertly while in combat.','You can take the Melee Attack or Ranged Attack action at any point during your movement. Normally you have to finish your movement before attacking.','You are hard to pin down in combat. Opponents do not gain an attack bonus for outnumbering you in melee. If you also have the Expert degree in the Single Weapon Style, your Defense bonus increases to +3 when fighting in that style.','You seem to have eyes in the back of your head.

INSERT INTO "Background" ("BackgroundName","BackgroundDescription","MainSocialClass","AbilityBonus") VALUES ('Academic','You spent a lot more time in schools and academic environments than your peers. Perhaps you lived at a boarding school, or someone in your family worked at a college or university. You’re inclined to be a bit more bookish and to  know your way around academic institutions.',2,5),
 ('Aristocratic','You come from a family with a history of privilege and responsibility, although it might have less of both these days. You might be actual nobility from an Earth culture that still has it, or “just” belong to an important family with equivalent wealth and influence.',3,3),
 ('Bohemian','You grew up in an experimental, eccentric, or creative community. Perhaps you belonged to a commune, an artist colony, or some “off the grid” intentional community. You may be the child of a group or polyamorous marriage, particularly on Earth. You’re unfamiliar with some of the things people take for granted, but had plenty of opportunities to expand your horizons. You might be trying to fit into mainstream society after some time away, or you might revel in your offbeat lifestyle.',0,3),
 ('Corporate','Your early life was tied up in corporate culture, most likely due to family members who built their lives around a company in some fashion. Your family might be influential stockholders or include powerful executives, and they may well have expected you to follow their example—whether you did or not.',3,3),
 ('Cosmopolitan','You were raised in a cosmopolitan environment: a big city, or even a series of great cities, where people from all over the world came and mixed. You were exposed to some of the best—and, potentially, the worst—of humanity and human achievement.',3,5),
 ('Exile','You might have lived a very different life were it not for some event that drove you from society. Feel free to roll again on the Social Class and Background tables to get a glimpse of what your former life was. Whatever the case, you (and possibly your family) were exiled by war, disaster, disgrace, or some other misfortune, forced to start over with virtually nothing.',0,1),
 ('Military','You grew up as a military brat. You were either a dependent with family members in military service, or you lived close by or on a military installation. You’re familiar with military culture and picked up a thing or two from it along the way.',1,2),
 ('Outcast','Fate singled you out for the life of an outcast on the fringes of society. You might have a criminal background that makes it impossible to find decent work and true respect, or you might belong to a minority group your society rejects. On Earth, you might have been an unlicensed and unregistered birth, a literal non-person. Whatever the case, you had to learn how to survive outside of the safety and structures most people rely upon.',0,8),
 ('Laborer','Your family is used to hard, physical work—and so are you. Generations have worked the factory line, the mines, the assembly line, or the dockyards. You might be looking to move on and move up from there, or stick with it, or something might have upended the life you once knew, forcing you to move on.',1,1),
 ('Suburban','Life for you once existed in the picturesque neighborhoods outside of the city but still just a short ride on public transportation to the shopping center. It might have been just as idyllic for you as the housing development brochures portrayed, or perhaps it was a cookie-cutter, conformist nightmare you couldn’t wait to escape.',2,3),
 ('Trade','Your family lived off a skilled trade of some sort. It might not have been glamorous (far from it, quite possibly) but it definitely paid the bills. You may have picked up some practical lessons and skills along the way. Perhaps you were ready to enter the family trade yourself, but you yearned for something new—and even dangerous.',2,4),
 ('Urban','You lived in the city, not in a high-rise or someplace with private security, but in the city. Its streets and vacant lots were your playgrounds, and you were navigating public transportation long before you could drive (as if you ever needed to drive). You know the ins and outs of an urban environment, even if it’s not the particular city where you lived, even if it’s a large station in the depths of an asteroid or moon, in fact. You know local eccentrics, dangerous people, and the secrets from the heart of the city.',1,4);
